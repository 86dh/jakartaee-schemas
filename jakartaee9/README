This directory contains everything necessary to build and test the Jakarta EE 9
deployment descriptors. 

See doc/HOWTO for directions.

The src directory contains the sources for the Java EE 8 schemas modified
slightly in preparation for their use in Jakarta EE 9.
The tests in the test directory have been updated accordingly.

Before using these schemas for Jakarta EE 9, the following changes
will need to be made:

- The files will need to be renamed to use the version number of
  the corresponding spec in Jakarta EE 9.
- The XML namespace will need to be updated to use a URL supported
  by the Eclipse Foundation.  (A placeholder URL has been used for now.)
